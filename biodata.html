      Hello, my name is Nur Syameera Binti Mohd Fauzi, but most people call me Meera or Syameera. I’m 20 years old, born at Universiti Malaya Medical Centre in Kuala Lumpur 
      on 8 August 2004, and I grew up in Klang, Selangor. My hobbies include watching movies and relaxing with ASMR mukbang videos on YouTube. I’m drawn to web design because
      it allows me to be creative with colors, layouts, and images to make websites look appealing.My passion for this career started when I worked on a website development task,
      which inspired me to pursue web design as my dream job, if all goes well. I’m also a huge fan of Kung Fu Panda movies—they’re my favorite! And I absolutely adore cats because 
      they can brighten any day with their sweet purrs and cuddles. I’m someone who values honesty and being a good listener, although I can be quiet at times and get easily hurt when
      something bothers me deeply. My favorite foods are tail soup and tomyam, which are both packed with flavor, while Teh Ais Medan is my go-to drink—it’s refreshing and hits the spot
      every time. One person I look up to is Aina Abdul; I admire her for her amazing voice and unique style, blending music with fashion. Overall,I’m grateful for the people and passions 
      that shape me, and I’m excited about the journey ahead as I work toward my dreams.</p>

      <p>Hello! My name is Nur Syameera Binti Mohd Fauzi, though most people simply call me Meera or Syameera. I’m 20 years old, born on August 8, 2004, at the Universiti Malaya Medical Centre
      in Kuala Lumpur, and raised in Klang, Selangor. I’m often known for my calm nature, but there’s a side of me that friends and family find warm and honest—I’m always ready to listen.
      While I’m generally quiet, I feel deeply, and though I try to stay positive, I admit I can become a bit sensitive when hurt. Oh, and I have an O blood type! They say people with blood type O 
      are less likely to get sick, but that’s just a myth. When I’m not busy with studies or work, I enjoy unwinding with simple hobbies. Watching movies is my favorite way to escape, especially Kung Fu
      Panda, which has been my all-time favorite from the very first movie. I also like relaxing with ASMR mukbang videos on YouTube; there’s something so soothing about them! My favorite foods are rich and 
      hearty, like tail soup and spicy tomyam, and for drinks, nothing beats a refreshing glass of teh ais medan—it's like a perfect playlist in a drink, sweet and always hits the spot. One day, I dream of becoming 
      a web designer. Designing websites is something I find truly exciting because it allows me to express creativity through colors, layouts, and images. When I had my first taste of developing a website, I knew right
      then that this was the field I wanted to pursue. If all goes well, and if it’s in God’s plan, I hope to make that dream a reality and create websites that not only look beautiful but are also user-friendly and unique.
      Of course, life wouldn’t be complete without a furry friend. My favorite pet is a cat—they have this amazing way of cheering me up with just a purr or a gentle cuddle. Whether I’m working, relaxing, or feeling a little down,
      my cat’s always there to lift my spirits. And when it comes to inspiration, Aina Abdul is someone I admire greatly. Her powerful voice and stylish fashion sense speak volumes, and she shares content that beautifully combines her love for music and style.</p>
